# Monitor Detection Fixes for standalone_focus_monitor.py

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Negative Coordinate Rejection**
- **Problem**: The code was rejecting windows with negative coordinates, which is incorrect for multi-monitor setups where secondary monitors to the left or above the primary monitor have negative coordinates.
- **Fix**: Removed the check for `x1 < 0 or y1 < 0` and only validate that the rectangle has positive width and height.

### 2. **Missing Monitor Information Logging**
- **Problem**: When monitor enumeration failed, it returned an empty list without any indication of what went wrong.
- **Fix**: Added error logging to track monitor enumeration failures and debug logging to show detected monitors.

### 3. **Poor Handling of Missing Monitor Data**
- **Problem**: When monitor enumeration failed, the code assumed min coordinates were (0,0), which could be incorrect.
- **Fix**: When monitors list is empty, use window coordinates to estimate minimum virtual desktop coordinates.

### 4. **No Window-to-Monitor Mapping**
- **Problem**: The code didn't track which monitor a window was on, making debugging difficult.
- **Fix**: Added `_get_window_monitor()` method that determines which monitor contains a window based on its center point.

### 5. **Lack of DPI Awareness**
- **Problem**: The application wasn't DPI-aware, which can cause issues with different DPI settings across monitors.
- **Fix**: Added `setup_dpi_awareness()` function that sets per-monitor DPI awareness (Windows 8.1+) with fallback to system DPI awareness.

### 6. **Limited Debug Information**
- **Problem**: Debug images didn't indicate which monitor the window was on.
- **Fix**: Enhanced debug image filenames to include monitor position information.

### 7. **Poor Error Handling in Screenshot Methods**
- **Problem**: Screenshot capture methods failed silently without logging specific errors.
- **Fix**: Added detailed debug logging for each capture method to track which method succeeds and why others fail.

### 8. **OCR Capture Not Multi-Monitor Aware**
- **Problem**: OCR capture didn't use `all_screens=True` parameter, potentially failing on secondary monitors.
- **Fix**: Updated OCR capture to try `all_screens=True` first with fallback to standard capture.

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Multi-Monitor Support**: The application now properly handles windows on any monitor, including those with negative coordinates.

2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the monitor detection and screenshot capture process.

3. **DPI Awareness**: The application is now DPI-aware, improving compatibility with different monitor configurations.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: When monitor enumeration fails, the code now attempts to continue with estimated values rather than failing completely.

5. **Monitor Tracking**: The application can now identify which monitor a window is on, useful for debugging resolution-related issues.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with monitors arranged in different configurations:
   - Secondary monitor to the left of primary (negative X coordinates)
   - Secondary monitor above primary (negative Y coordinates)
   - Different resolutions on each monitor
   - Different DPI/scaling settings on each monitor

2. Test window detection when:
   - Window is moved between monitors
   - Window spans multiple monitors
   - Window is on a monitor that's disconnected and reconnected

3. Enable `COLOR_DETECTION_DEBUG = True` temporarily to verify screenshot captures are working correctly on all monitors.
