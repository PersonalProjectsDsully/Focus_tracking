# Focus Tracking

This repository provides a small set of scripts for monitoring window focus activity on Windows and visualising the collected data.

## Contents

* `standalone_focus_monitor.py` – a command line tool that records the currently focused window over time. It writes log files and daily summaries to a `focus_logs` directory. This script runs completely locally and does not capture screenshots.
* `focus_monitor_dashboard.py` – a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard that reads the log files generated by the tool and displays interactive charts. The dashboard also lets you manage custom labels for grouping or renaming applications.

## Requirements

The scripts are intended for Windows and require Python 3.8 or later. The main dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some functionality such as window detection relies on the [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) package, which only works on Windows systems.

## Usage

1. **Run the focus monitor tool**
   ```bash
   python standalone_focus_monitor.py
   ```
   Optional arguments include:
   - `--output-dir` to specify where logs are saved (defaults to the script directory)
   - `--interval` to change the sampling interval (seconds)
   - `--summary-interval` to control how often summaries are generated

   Log files and summaries are written into `focus_logs/`.

2. **Launch the dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run focus_monitor_dashboard.py
   ```
   The dashboard reads files from `focus_logs/` and provides visual summaries and a label editor.
